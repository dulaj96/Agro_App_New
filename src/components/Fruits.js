    information:
      '\u25AA Botanical name :- MangiferaIndica \n\n\u25AA Recommended Mango Varieties :- \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  Horanahiru \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  3 Karthacolomban \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  Velleicolomban \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  Villard \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  TOM EJC \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  Malwana \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  Dampara \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \u2043  Giraamba \n\n\u25AA Climate requirement :- Well grown in tropical & subtropical regions. Can be grown up to 1300 m. But commercial cultivation is successful from sea level to 600 m of height and optimum temperature is between 27 c0– 30 c0.\n\t\t\tAnnual rainfall should be average of 500-2500ml for better growth. In Sri Lanka flowering is highly affected by the rain fall pattern are finally results irritations of yield & quality of the crop affected.\n\n\u25AA Soil :- Mangoes can be grown in a wide range of soil types. Deep, rich, well drained soils provide the best production. Water logging soils are not suitable for mango production. The pH   range of soil should be 5.5 – 7.5.\n\n\u25AA Field Preparation :- This is best done before the onset of the rainy season. Shrubs and trees should be cut down, preferable up rooted and the debris removed from the site.In flat and gently sloping lands, although hilly lands can also be planted. In hilly areas, before planting proper soil conservation methods should be applied.\n\n\u25AA Planting Materials :- Budded or grafted plants are recommended. The plant should reflect the characters of its variety and label, which certified by the DOA.\n\n\u25AA Spacing :- Willard should space 7m in within row & 10m in between row. Other verities should space 10m in within row & 10m in between row.\n\n\u25AA Spacing for TOM EJC :- High density planting is practiced for commercial cultivation of TOM EJC in Sri Lanka. 5‹5m, 5‹6m, 5‹6m, 6‹6m spacings are practiced and 5‹5m is the most applicable spacing.\n\t\t\tThe size of the planting hole should be 60 cm‹60 cm‹ 60 cm. If there is a very hard soil hole should be 90 cm‹90 cm ‹90 cm in size.\n\t\t\tThen refill the planting hole with organic manure and top soil (20kg of organic manure) before the 2 weeks of planting.\n\n\u25AA Irrigation :- Water the trees right after planting and during drought periods. If dry season comes just after planting, water the trees regularly at least of 3 days interval. The watering of trees after 3 years of age should be managed in order to get higher yield. The watering should be stopped before 3-4 months of flowing initiation.\n\t\t\tIf prolong adverse drought period exists watering should be done only for surviving the plants. With the initiation of flowering watering should be practiced regularly up to fruit maturing stage.\n\n\u25AA Pruning :- Better canopy management is essential to have good productivity of any mango variety. In mango, increase in production with enhanced fruit quality is achieved by managing canopies.\n\n\u25AA The pruning should aim for :- \n\t\t\u2043 Maximum utilization of light.\n\t\t\u2043 Avoidance of built- up microclimate spots for diseases & post late infestation.\n\t\t\u2043 Convenience in carrying out the cultural practices.\n\t\t\u2043 Maximizing the productivity with quality fruit production.\n\n\u25AA Flowing induction :- Paclobutrazol is applied to induce flowing. This should be applied at correct stage with correct concentration of chemical to get better results.\n\n\u25AA Harvesting & post-harvest indices of mango :- The quality and the postharvest standard of the mango fruit depends on the time and stage of maturity at harvest. The number of days from flowering and fruit set to harvest is a good nondestructive maturity index for mangoes.\n\n\u25AA Harvesting :- Harvesting should be done between 10.00 am to 3.00 pm, using a fruit picker. Fruits keep upside down position to remove wax and let latex flow away from the fruit.\n\n\u25AA Grading of fruits :- Remove diseased, infested, deformed and very small fruits. The fruits are graded into 3 groups by its size.\n\n\u25AA Packaging & transportation :- Proper packaging is essential in maintaining produce quality during transport. Wood or plastic crates are highly recommended for fresh mangoes.\n\n\u25AA Hot water treatment (HWT) :- HWT is the most effective post-harvest treatment against the main post harvest diseases of mango. During HWT, mature fruits are dipped for 5 to10 minutes in water heated to 52 co-55co. At this temperature range, the disease- causing organisms are killed without injuring the fruit.\n\n\u25AA Fruit ripening :- Fruits can be ripened by exposing them to ethral, which initiate the early and uniform ripening process. Now a day mango traders use calcium carbide for ripening. Calcium carbide contains impurities of arsenic and phosphorus hydrides which are toxic to human health. But ethylene is a natural hormone does not pose any health hazard for consumers of the fruits.\n\n\u25AA Using Ethrel for fruit ripening method :- \n\t\t\u2043 Sealed container.\n\t\t\u2043 A solution which dissolved 1 ml ethrel in 1l of water.\n\t\t\u2043 A solution much dissolved in 10g of  Ca(OH)2 in 1 l of water.\n\t\t\u2043 Place the fruits inside the ripening chamber with facilitate air circulation inside the chamber and then room should be sealed. Leave 1/5 of the chamber free from mangoes.\n\t\t\u2043 Use 110-150 ml of ethrel for 1m3 of volume. Keep the ethrel container inside the chamber and pour Ca(OH)2 solution into it. The volume of Ca(OH)2 is 185 ml of Ca(OH)2 for 1m3 of volume of the chamber. close the container tightly just after putting Ca(OH)2.\n\t\t\u2043 After 24 hours open the chamber and facilitate aeration.\n\t\t\u2043 Ethrel can be stored in a amber color bottle for few months.',
